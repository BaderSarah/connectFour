# connectFour
Connect Four is a two-player connection game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

This project is a Python remake of the popular game "Four in a Row", implemented using the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface.
